The example consists of a locally running Loopback backend providing a REST API to a simple table and a Swift application utilizing it.

## Employee REST API
The backend consists of a REST API providing CRUD access to table *Employee* and is created via Loopback 4. If you do not have any Loopback 4 background, you are advised to first have a look at Loopback 4 Getting started (https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Getting-started.html) for setting up the environment as well as the Loopback 4 Todo tutorial (https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/todo-tutorial.html) for an overview of the steps necessary to build an app using Loopback4.

### Create the app
Use *lb4 app* to create the backend application:
